What's this?
========

This repository contains the demo material the "Android and OSGi" talk given at JFall, 2012-10-31. The numbers in the project names refer to marked examples in the slidedeck.

How do I play with this?
=========
Tools
--------
I used,

- Eclipse 4.2
- Android Toolkit 20 (?)
- BNDTools 1.0

Playing with the project
--------

The repository contains an Eclipse workspace. Clone it, point your Eclipse to it (use the directory as a workspace), and import the projects using `File -> Import... -> Existing Projects into Workspace`.

You can now run every project that is an Android project; the other project projects with the same number prefix are projects that contain BNDTools bundles.


Some examples are broken!
=========
That's the point, read the slidedeck :)
